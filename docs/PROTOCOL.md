# How simbeam works

A plain-language tour of the protocol: the actors, what happens on first connect,
how pairing works, how a paired session talks, and how TURN and subscriptions fit in.

This document describes **observable behavior and wire messages**, not code internals.
It is meant to be readable on its own and complete enough to implement a client (e.g. an
iPad app) against. Exact field-level constructions are included where a client must
reproduce them byte-for-byte.

A [glossary](#glossary) at the bottom explains every abbreviation.

---

## The three actors

| Actor | Where it runs | What it does |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Daemon** (`simbeamd`) | on the Mac | Owns the simulators. Streams H.264 video, accepts touch/keyboard input. Has a permanent cryptographic identity. |
| **Broker** (`simbeam-signal`) | on a server (public or self-hosted) | A meeting point. Helps a client and a daemon find each other and exchange a WebRTC handshake. Also issues TURN credentials and stores subscriptions. |
| **Client** | iPad app / browser | Watches which Macs are online, pairs with a Mac once, then connects to see and control a simulator. |

### What the broker is — and isn't

The broker is **only a rendezvous point**. Think of it as a phone switchboard: it connects
two parties and then steps aside. Specifically:

- It relays a handful of small JSON messages so a client and a daemon can complete a WebRTC
  handshake.
- After the handshake, **video and control flow directly peer-to-peer** between client and
  Mac. The broker never sees them.
- All media is end-to-end encrypted by WebRTC itself (DTLS-SRTP) — true even if traffic is
  relayed through TURN. **A malicious or compromised broker cannot eavesdrop or impersonate
  either side.** It can only refuse to connect you.

Because the broker can't be fully trusted, both ends authenticate each other with their own
keys (see [Pairing](#pairing) and [Connecting](#connecting-a-paired-session)). The broker is
*untrusted by design*.

Everything the daemon does is **outbound**: it dials the broker, it never listens for inbound
connections. The Mac opens **zero ports**. This is why simbeam works from behind a home
router without any port forwarding.

---

## First connect

Everyone connects to the broker over a single WebSocket endpoint: `wss://<broker>/ws`.
The very first message you send declares who you are and what you want.

### The daemon comes online

When `simbeamd` starts (or wakes from sleep), it dials the broker and **registers**:

```json
{ "type": "register", "role": "daemon", "daemon": "<daemonID>" }
```

- `daemonID` is the daemon's **public key** (Ed25519, base64). It is stable — the same Mac
  always has the same `daemonID` — so it doubles as the Mac's permanent address on the broker.
- The daemon then *stays connected*, holding this WebSocket open with automatic reconnect and
  keepalive pings. As long as that socket is alive, the Mac is considered **online**.

The daemon does not need a client to be present. It registers and waits.

### The client comes online

A client doesn't have to authenticate to *look around*. Its first action is usually to ask
which of its known Macs are online — see [Presence](#presence-who-is-online) next. To actually
connect, it sends a `join` (see [Connecting](#connecting-a-paired-session)).

---

## Presence: who is online

A client can check whether a Mac is online **without any authentication**, knowing only its
`daemonID` (which is a public key — not a secret). This powers the green/grey online dots in
the UI.

The client opens a WebSocket and its **first message** is a watch request listing the Macs it
cares about:

```json
{ "type": "watch", "daemons": ["<daemonID-A>", "<daemonID-B>"] }
```

The broker immediately replies with a **snapshot** of their current state:

```json
{ "type": "presence", "states": { "<daemonID-A>": true, "<daemonID-B>": false } }
```

After that, the broker pushes a small **delta** whenever any watched Mac comes or goes — one
key at a time:

```json
{ "type": "presence", "states": { "<daemonID-A>": false } }
```

`true` = that Mac's daemon currently holds a live WebSocket to the broker. `false` = offline.
The watch connection stays open; the client just listens. No keys, no signatures — presence is
public information keyed by a public key.

> **Why this is safe:** knowing a `daemonID` lets you see if a Mac is online and *attempt* to
> connect, but you still can't connect unless that Mac has pinned your key during pairing. The
> daemonID is an address, not a credential.

---

## Pairing

Before a client can ever connect to a Mac, the two must **pair** once. Pairing teaches the
daemon to trust one specific client key. After that, the client reconnects forever with no
further pairing.

**Pairing is just a dial-up/introduction layer.** It does not move any video or control. It
exists solely so the daemon learns "this client key is allowed," and the client learns "this
is the real Mac's key."

### What the daemon generates and shows

The Mac's owner triggers pairing by pressing **P** in the daemon's terminal. The daemon then:

1. Generates a short-lived **one-time pairing secret `S`** (random, ~12 characters, expires in
   a few minutes, usable once).
2. Builds a **pairing URL** and renders it as a QR code in the terminal.

The pairing URL carries everything the client needs, in the URL **fragment** (the part after
`#`, which browsers and servers never send over the network — it stays on the device):

```
https://<client-app>/#signal=<wss-broker-url>&daemon=<daemonID>&pair=<S>
```

| Parameter | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `signal`  | the broker's WebSocket URL to dial — **optional** (see below) |
| `daemon`  | the daemon's public key (`daemonID`) — the client **pins** this as the real Mac |
| `pair`    | the one-time secret `S` |

`signal` is omitted from released daemons' pairing URLs: the hosted client
(`app.simbeam.dev`) already knows its default broker (`wss://signal.simbeam.dev/ws`),
so repeating it only lengthens the URL and its QR. A daemon prints `signal` only when
it talks to a *different* broker (local dev, self-hosted) — so the client always
learns a broker it wouldn't otherwise assume. Absent `signal` ⇒ client uses its
baked default.

### What the client does with it

The client scans the QR (or opens the URL) and reads `signal` (falling back to its
default broker when absent), `daemon`, and `pair` from the fragment. It then:

1. Generates **its own** permanent keypair (Ed25519) if it doesn't already have one. Its public
   key is `clientPubKey`.
2. Picks a random `nonce`.
3. Computes an **enrollment proof** that demonstrates it knows `S` *without sending `S`*:

   ```
   pair_proof = base64( HMAC-SHA256( S, clientPubKey || 0x00 || nonce ) )
   ```

   (the message is the base64 `clientPubKey` string, a single `0x00` byte, then the base64
   `nonce` string).

4. Connects to the broker and sends a **join** carrying the proof:

```json
{
  "type":  "join",
  "role":  "client",
  "daemon": "<daemonID>",
  "pubkey": "<clientPubKey>",
  "nonce":  "<nonce>",
  "pair":   "<pair_proof>"
}
```

The secret `S` never travels to the broker — only the HMAC proof does, so the untrusted broker
can't learn `S` or replay it.

### What the daemon receives and saves

The broker relays the join to the daemon as a **connect**:

```json
{ "type": "connect", "pubkey": "<clientPubKey>", "nonce": "<nonce>", "pair": "<pair_proof>" }
```

The daemon recomputes the same HMAC with its secret `S`. If it matches and the pairing window
is still open, the daemon **pins** `clientPubKey` — it saves the client's public key to its
trusted list (`~/.simbeam/clients.json`). From now on, this client is recognized and the
pairing window is burned (one-time use). If that save fails, the daemon refuses the connection
rather than pretending to pair, so a client is never told it paired when it didn't.

After pinning, the client still completes the normal key challenge (next section) to finish the
connection. The client knows the pin **stuck** when it receives the `hello` greeting with
`paired: true` on the control channel (see [the live session](#the-live-session-control-and-video)).
A client should treat pairing as **confirmed only on that `hello`**: if it saved the Mac
optimistically on scan but the connection drops before `hello` arrives, the pin may not have
landed — discard and re-pair rather than leaving a Mac that's saved on the client but unknown to
the daemon (and therefore permanently unreachable). A revoked device is removed with
`simbeamd unpair <clientPubKey>`.

That's pairing: a one-time, secret-gated introduction that ends with **the daemon trusting the
client's public key** and **the client trusting the daemon's public key**. Neither secret nor
key ever has to be exchanged again.

---

## Connecting (a paired session)

Once paired, connecting is a **mutual key challenge** followed by the WebRTC handshake. The
broker relays the messages but learns nothing it could use to impersonate either side.

### What each side does

- **The daemon listens** (via the broker) for a paired client to show up. It already holds its
  permanent WebSocket open (it's online). When a client joins, the daemon challenges it to prove
  it owns a pinned key, then answers its WebRTC offer.
- **The client sends** a `join` (this time with no `pair` — it's already pinned), signs the
  challenge, then sends a WebRTC offer.
- **The broker relays** these messages, and *additionally* slips in its own challenge so it can
  independently confirm the client's key (this is what gates TURN — see below). It strips its own
  bits back out before forwarding, so the daemon and client only ever see what concerns them.

### The handshake, step by step

```

1. **join** — client announces itself: `{ "type":"join", "role":"client", "daemon":"<daemonID>",
   "pubkey":"<clientPubKey>", "nonce":"<nonce>" }`.
2. **challenge** — the daemon sends a random `nonce` for the client to sign. The broker adds its
   own `brokerNonce` to the same message:
   `{ "type":"challenge", "nonce":"<daemonNonce>", "brokerNonce":"<brokerNonce>" }`.
3. **proof** — the client signs **both** nonces with its private key:
   `{ "type":"proof", "sig":"<sign(daemonNonce)>", "brokerSig":"<sign(brokerNonce)>" }`.
   - The daemon verifies `sig` against the pinned `clientPubKey` → confirms it's really the paired
     client.
   - The broker verifies `brokerSig` independently → confirms the client's key for TURN gating,
     then removes `brokerSig` before forwarding.
4. **iceServers** — the broker sends each side the ICE configuration to use (STUN always; TURN if
   the client has an active subscription). See [TURN](#turn-and-subscriptions). The same message
   carries the trickle verdict (step 6).
5. **offer / answer** — the client (offerer) sends a standard WebRTC SDP **offer**. The daemon
   (answerer) replies with an SDP **answer** *and signs it* with its private key:
   `{ "type":"answer", "sdp":"<...>", "sig":"<sign(sdp)>" }`. The client verifies `sig` against the
   pinned `daemonID` — this is the anti-MITM check that proves the answer came from the real Mac and
   not a broker substituting its own.
6. **candidate** *(trickle ICE)* — instead of holding the offer/answer until ICE gathering has
   finished (which means waiting for the slowest TURN allocation, seconds on mobile), each side
   sends its SDP immediately and streams candidates as they appear:
   `{ "type":"candidate", "candidate":"candidate:...", "sdpMid":"0", "sdpMLineIndex":0 }`, with an
   empty `candidate` marking end-of-candidates. Both peers opt in — the daemon with
   `"trickle":true` on `register`, the client on `join` — and the broker ANDs the two onto the
   `iceServers` message. Anything missing that field (an older broker, daemon, or client) falls
   back to the original all-candidates-inside-the-SDP behaviour.
   Trickled candidates ride outside the answer signature. A hostile broker could inject one, but
   the DTLS fingerprint stays inside the *signed* SDP, so an injected candidate cannot impersonate
   the Mac — it can only waste connectivity checks.

After the answer, ICE completes and the WebRTC connection comes up **directly between client and
Mac**. The broker's job is done.

Only one client talks to a given daemon at a time; if a second client joins, the broker drops the
first.

### The live session: control and video

Three WebRTC channels carry everything from here on, peer-to-peer: `control` (commands),
`bulk` (large or must-not-drop requests) and the H.264 video track.

**Control — a DataChannel labeled `control`** carries JSON commands from client to daemon and
replies back. It is **unreliable and unordered** (`maxRetransmits: 0`): a message may be dropped
and never retried. That is right for a stream of taps — a stale tap is worse than a lost one — but
it means anything that must arrive belongs on `bulk` instead.

The client sends:

| Command | Shape | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| boot    | `{"type":"boot","udid":"<udid>"}` | power on a simulator |
| shutdown| `{"type":"shutdown","udid":"<udid>"}` | power off a simulator |
| restart | `{"type":"restart","udid":"<udid>"}` | power-cycle a simulator: shut down, boot again, reply `booted`. The cure for a `display_not_ready` attach — see [Attaching](#attaching-a-simulator) |
| attach  | `{"type":"attach","udid":"<udid>","scale":<0.25–1.0>,"bitrate":<bits/s>}` | start streaming this simulator's screen; `scale`/`bitrate` optional, see [Video quality](#video-quality) |
| detach  | `{"type":"detach"}` | stop streaming |
| tap     | `{"type":"tap","x":0.5,"y":0.5}` | tap at normalized [0,1] coordinates |
| touch   | `{"type":"touch","action":"down"\|"move"\|"up","x":..,"y":..}` | one phase of a client-driven touch stream: trajectory and pacing are the client's (curved swipes, long-press, drag with pauses). Single-finger only; while the stream finger is down, `tap`/`swipe` are dropped by the companion |
| swipe   | `{"type":"swipe","x1":..,"y1":..,"x2":..,"y2":..,"duration":<sec>}` | drag |
| home    | `{"type":"home"}` | press the Home button |
| app_switcher | `{"type":"app_switcher"}` | open the app switcher (the double Home press is serialized inside the companion, so its timing window is guaranteed) |
| key     | `{"type":"key","key":"<KeyboardEvent.key>"}` | a hardware key press |
| shake   | `{"type":"shake"}` | shake the attached simulator (e.g. to trigger Shake to Undo); fire-and-forget, no reply |
| hello   | `{"type":"hello"}` | re-request the greeting: the on-open `hello` rides this lossy channel and doubles as the pin-ack, so a client that hasn't received one shortly after the channel opens asks again (idempotent; daemons ≤ v0.12.0 ignore it) |

Coordinates are **normalized 0–1** relative to the displayed frame; the daemon scales them to the
simulator's logical points.

`touch` rides this same lossy channel, so clients must budget for drops: coalesce `move` events
client-side (a lost move only dents the trajectory), and treat `up` as the one message that
matters — send it redundantly if needed. The companion self-heals the worst case: a re-`down`
first releases the previous finger, and process EOF releases a hanging one. (Keyboard input sends physical HID key codes — the actual character is
chosen by the keyboard layout active *inside the simulator*.)

The daemon replies on the same channel:

| Reply | Shape |
|-------|-------|
| hello    | `{"type":"hello","name":"<Mac name>","osVersion":"<macOS version>","paired":true,"version":"<semver>","caps":["touch","app_switcher","lifecycle","trickle"],"latestVersion":"<semver>"}` — `version` is the daemon's own version; `caps` lists the optional control features this daemon+backend forwards, and it is how a client learns it may stream `touch`/send `app_switcher`/put lifecycle on `bulk` (**gate on membership; a hello without `caps` is a daemon ≤ v0.11 → assume the v1 gesture set** — the demo backend advertises only `lifecycle` and `trickle`, it swallows touch). `trickle` is the odd one out and gates nothing: this message arrives long after the connection trickle ICE exists to speed up, so the real negotiation is in signalling. It is diagnostic — a client that asked for trickle and got `"trickle":false` on `iceServers` can tell an old broker (this cap present) from an old daemon (cap absent). `latestVersion` appears only when the daemon's daily GitHub-Releases check found a newer simbeamd; clients may show an "update the Mac side" nudge (`brew upgrade`) |
| booted   | `{"type":"booted","udid":"<udid>"}` — from a `boot`, or from a completed `restart` |
| shutdown | `{"type":"shutdown","udid":"<udid>"}` (if it was the streaming sim, a `detached` is sent first) |
| attaching | `{"type":"attaching","udid":"<udid>"}` — the attach was accepted; a terminal reply follows. See [Attaching](#attaching-a-simulator) |
| attached | `{"type":"attached","udid":"<udid>","w":<px>,"h":<px>}` (the simulator's **native** screen size — see below) |
| detached | `{"type":"detached","udid":"<udid>"}` — `udid` is the device that stopped, including one whose attach was still starting |
| stream_ended | `{"type":"stream_ended","udid":"<udid>","msg":"<reason>"}` — the feed died on its own; **not** sent when you ended it |
| error    | `{"type":"error","operation":"attach\|boot\|restart\|shutdown","udid":"<udid>","code":"<machine code>","retryable":<bool>,"msg":"<reason>"}` |

`operation` says which request failed and `udid` which device, so a failure needs no correlation by
arrival order. `retryable` says whether re-sending that same request unchanged is worth it; it is
omitted when false.

**The `hello` greeting** is the **first** message the daemon sends, pushed *unsolicited* the
moment the client opens the `control` channel (before any command). It carries:

- `name` — the Mac's display name (e.g. `"Kirill's MacBook Pro"`), for the UI subtitle.
- `osVersion` — the macOS version (e.g. `"26.5"`). Note the field is **`osVersion`** (camelCase),
  *not* the `os_version` used inside a simulator's `sims` entry.
- `paired: true` — an explicit **pin-acknowledgement**. Reaching the control channel is only
  possible past the key challenge, which an enrolling client clears only after the daemon has
  durably saved its key. So a `hello` is proof the pairing actually took (see
  [Pairing](#pairing)). Either string field may be absent if the daemon couldn't read it; the
  client just omits that subtitle.

**Bulk — a DataChannel labeled `bulk`** is **reliable and ordered**, and unlike `control` it is
created by the **client**; the daemon routes it by label. It carries what `control` must not: a
request too large for one message, or one that may not be silently dropped.

| Request | Shape | Reply |
|---------|-------|-------|
| list       | `{"type":"list"}` | the Mac's simulators, `chunked` — header `{"type":"sims","bytes":N}` + binary chunks → JSON array `[{"udid":..,"name":..,"os_version":..,"state":..}, …]` (empty list → `[]`). Same framing as a screenshot; see [Chunked transfers](#chunked-transfers-screenshots-and-the-simulator-list) |
| screenshot | `{"type":"screenshot"}` | a full-resolution PNG, `chunked` — see [Chunked transfers](#chunked-transfers-screenshots-and-the-simulator-list) |
| quality    | `{"type":"quality","scale":<0.25–1.0>,"bitrate":<bits/s>}` | `{"type":"quality","scale":…,"bitrate":…}` — what actually took effect |
| *lifecycle* | `boot`, `restart`, `attach`, `detach`, `shutdown` — byte for byte the messages from the `control` table | the same replies, delivered here instead |

**Put lifecycle on `bulk` when the daemon advertises `lifecycle` in its `caps`.** Requests and
replies are identical on both channels, so this is purely a choice of transport — but `control` may
drop either half, and a lost `attach` looks exactly like a lost `attached`: the client can only sit
and wait. Send input on `control`, where a stale tap is worse than a lost one, and lifecycle on
`bulk`, where nothing is ever dropped.

**A reply always comes back on the channel that carried the request**, so a daemon never answers on
a channel you aren't reading. Once you have sent one lifecycle request on `bulk`, unsolicited
lifecycle events (`stream_ended`) go there too.

Lifecycle errors and request errors are both `{"type":"error"}` on this channel; the lifecycle ones
carry `operation`, the `list`/`screenshot`/`quality` ones never do.

**Every bulk frame — text or binary — is at most 1024 bytes.** The transfer must fit a single SCTP
packet. On an IPv6 path (Tailscale, native cellular: 1280-byte minimum link MTU, no in-network
fragmentation, PMTUD usually filtered) any bulk message the stack splits across more than one packet
**black-holes** — the fragment exceeds 1280, routers drop it silently, and SCTP retransmits the same
oversized chunk forever, while small single-packet frames (`hello`, a `quality` echo) sail through.
So a reply larger than one packet is never one frame: it is chunked (below), and the four-field
`sims` array is deliberately slim — `model`, `architecture` and `type` are dropped — to stay small.

The `sims` reply lives on `bulk`, not `control`: it is the largest and most critical control message,
and on a cellular/relay path `control`'s unreliable delivery dropped it with no retransmission,
hanging the list screen on a spinner forever. The client requests `list` once the channels open and
re-requests until the `sims` reply arrives, so the daemon answers every `list` (it is idempotent).

Every bulk request gets a reply: the payload above, or
`{"type":"error","msg":"<reason>","code":"<machine code>"}` — branch on `code`, never on `msg`. Keep
one request in flight: replies carry no correlation id, and a `screenshot` capture can occupy the
channel for up to 15s.

| `code` | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `unknown_type`   | This daemon has no such request — i.e. it predates it. See [detecting an old daemon](#video-quality). |
| `bad_request`    | The request wasn't valid JSON. |
| `no_attachment`  | Nothing is attached to act on. `attach` first. |
| `capture_failed` | The request was fine; the capture or its transfer failed. Retryable. |
| `list_failed`    | The request was fine; enumerating the simulators failed. Retryable. |

**Video — an H.264 track** flows from daemon to client. The track is negotiated up front but stays
**silent until you `attach` a simulator**. On `attach`, the daemon starts capturing that simulator
and pushing H.264; on `detach` (or a new `attach`), it stops. You don't renegotiate the WebRTC
session to switch simulators — the video track just goes quiet and resumes.

### Attaching a simulator

Attach is asynchronous, and it is the one lifecycle request that can take seconds: the daemon spawns
a capture process and, on a cold-booted simulator, waits for the device to produce its first
framebuffer. So it answers twice.

```
→ {"type":"attach","udid":"…"}
← {"type":"attaching","udid":"…"}          accepted; the device that owns the outcome
← {"type":"attached","udid":"…","w":…,"h":…}      … or exactly one of:
← {"type":"error","operation":"attach","udid":"…","code":"display_not_ready","retryable":true,"msg":"…"}
```

**Every accepted attach ends, and within a bounded interval** (30s; the capture process is given
less than that, so its own typed failure wins the race). It ends in one of four ways:

- `attached` — streaming.
- `error` with `operation: "attach"` — it failed, and `code` says why.
- **a reply to something newer.** A `detach`, `shutdown` or `restart` you sent while the attach was
  still starting cancels it, and *that* request's reply (`detached`, `shutdown`, `booted`) is the
  end of the attach. The cancelled attach itself says nothing more — it must not, or you would get a
  contradicting `attached` for a device you already dismissed.
- **another `attaching`.** A second attach supersedes the first the same way.

So: treat any `attaching` as "the previous attach is over", and any of `detached` / `shutdown` /
`booted` as terminal for whatever attach was in flight. Nothing else is needed — no timers, no
correlation ids.

**The failure codes** come from the capture helper and are stable:

| `code` | `retryable` | Meaning and what to do |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| `device_not_booted` | yes | The simulator is still coming up. `attach` again shortly. |
| `display_not_ready` | yes | It booted but never produced a framebuffer within the helper's deadline. Retrying rarely helps — this is what `restart` is for. |
| `device_not_found` | no | No such udid. Re-`list`. |
| `core_simulator_unavailable` | no | The Mac's simulator subsystem is not usable (broken/absent Xcode). A human has to fix the Mac. |
| `encoder_failed` | no | The video encoder could not start. |
| `hid_unavailable` | no | Input could not be wired up. |
| `invalid_arguments` | no | A daemon/helper version mismatch. Report it. |
| `attach_failed` | no | The backend refused with no code of its own. |
| `attach_timeout` | no | Neither a feed nor a typed failure inside the bound. Treat like `display_not_ready`: offer a restart. |

**`retryable` is the only branch you need**: true → send the same `attach` again; false → offer the
user a `restart` of that simulator, then attach again once `booted` lands. A restart works
in-session — you never reconnect to the Mac.

```
← {"type":"error","operation":"attach","udid":"…","code":"display_not_ready","retryable":true}
→ {"type":"restart","udid":"…"}
← {"type":"booted","udid":"…"}       the device is freshly booted, and any feed it had is gone
→ {"type":"attach","udid":"…"}
```

`restart` is deliberately quiet about the feed it drops: you asked for it, so there is no `detached`
and no `stream_ended` — just `booted` when the device is back. It can hold the channel for the
length of a shutdown+boot cycle, so keep one request in flight.

**`stream_ended` is the opposite case: a feed that died without being asked to.** The capture
process exited, the simulator went away, or the track broke.

```
← {"type":"stream_ended","udid":"…","msg":"…"}
```

You get it *only* for deaths you did not cause. Ending the feed yourself — `detach`, `shutdown`,
`restart`, a new `attach`, or the session closing — is confirmed by that request's own reply and
never doubled with a `stream_ended`. On receiving one, the daemon is already idle: drop your video
UI and `attach` again if you want the stream back.

### Chunked transfers (screenshots and the simulator list)

A reply too big for one 1024-byte packet is sent as a **header followed by binary chunks**. Both the
full-resolution screenshot and the `sims` list use this exact framing — only the header's `type` and
the reassembled payload differ.

The video track is lossy and downscaled, so a screenshot is **not** grabbed from it. `{"type":
"screenshot"}` on `bulk` makes the daemon capture the attached device fresh, at its **native full
resolution**, straight from the source — bypassing the video pipeline entirely. A PNG of a retina
screen is several megabytes; the `sims` array is a few kilobytes. Either way:

```
← {"type":"screenshot","bytes":3145728}    ← text frame: parse type + total size
← <binary chunk>                            ← binary frames, each ≤ 1024 bytes …
← <binary chunk>
← <binary chunk>                            ← … concatenating to exactly 3145728 bytes
```

**Reassembly:** append the binary frames in arrival order until you hold exactly `bytes` bytes, then
parse per the header's `type` — a `screenshot` blob is the PNG, a `sims` blob is the JSON simulator
array. There are no sequence numbers and none are needed: `bulk` is reliable and ordered, so chunks
cannot arrive out of order or go missing. The header's `bytes` is your only end-of-transfer signal;
the daemon sends no terminator. Each chunk is capped at 1024 bytes, so expect many small chunks
rather than a few large ones.

**Success vs failure is the frame type, not the content.** A successful transfer is one *text*
frame (the header) followed by *binary* frames. A failure is a single *text* frame:
`{"type":"error","msg":"<reason>","code":"<machine code>"}`. Branch on whether the frame arrived as
binary or text — do not try to parse a chunk as JSON. Errors you should expect: nothing attached,
the capture failed, the capture came back empty, or (for `list`) enumerating the simulators failed.

**Frame size is the daemon's business; you just append whatever arrives.** Every frame is at most
1024 bytes — one SCTP packet, so nothing black-holes on an IPv6 path (see the cap note above the
request table). Don't assume a particular chunk size or count; reassemble by the header's `bytes`.

**The daemon always replies** — image or error — and bounds the capture at ~15s so a wedged
simulator can't leave you waiting on your own timeout.

### Video quality

The client chooses the stream's quality; the daemon owns the allowed range. Two knobs:

| Field | Range | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `scale`   | `0.25` – `1.0` | resolution multiplier of the device's **native** capture. `1.0` = full retina, `0.5` = each dimension halved (a quarter of the pixels). |
| `bitrate` | `500000` – `16000000` | H.264 target, bits/s. |

**There are no presets on the wire — the daemon takes numbers.** Presets are the client's to define
and name; keeping them out of the daemon means the client is free to offer whatever UI it likes.

**Omit a field (or send `0`) to get the daemon's default**, which is what the stream has always
been: `scale` `0.5` for a simulator, `1.0` for the hosted demo device; `bitrate` `8000000` for both.
A client that sends neither field streams exactly as it did before this feature existed.

**Out of range clamps — it does not fail.** Ask for `scale: 9` and you get `1.0`. This is why the
reply echoes the applied values: they are what the daemon *did*, not what you asked for. Render
your UI from the echo, or it will show a preset that never took effect.

**Two ways to set it, and they are not interchangeable:**

- **On `attach` (control channel)** — the starting quality. The feed spawns with it directly, so
  this is **free**: one feed, one build.
- **Mid-session via `quality` (bulk channel)** — changes a *live* stream. This **rebuilds the feed**
  (see the cost below). Use it when the network shifts under a session; that is what it is for.

> **Put your starting quality on `attach`.** Attaching first and then sending `quality` builds the
> feed twice and adds ~1.5s to every session start, for nothing. If your client has no mid-session
> control at all, you never need to send `quality` — the `attach` fields are the whole feature.

`quality` deliberately rides `bulk` and not `control`: `control` may drop the message, and it would
do so on exactly the degraded link that makes you want to lower quality.

**What a change looks like on screen.** The picture freezes on the last frame and resumes at the new
quality after **roughly 1.5s** on a simulator: the daemon rebuilds the whole capture feed, and
respawning the `idb_companion` sidecar alone measures ~1.2s. Budget for it in the UI — a slider that
re-requests on every drag will stutter badly, so commit on release, and show that something is
happening.

The WebRTC session is *not* renegotiated and the track does not restart; the new keyframe resyncs
your decoder, resolution change included. `<video>` (or your native decoder) will report the new
dimensions on its own.

Note the reply comes back **immediately**, before the new feed is up — it confirms the daemon
accepted the values, not that the picture has changed. The rebuild's own outcome follows like any
other attach's — `attached`, or one typed `error` with `operation: "attach"` — on whichever channel
you send lifecycle on (`control` if you have never sent lifecycle over `bulk`).

**`quality` needs a live feed.** With nothing attached it replies `error` — it is a change to a
running stream, not a stored preference. Put the starting quality on `attach`.

**Why there is no `fps`.** Capture, not encoding, is the ceiling: one screenshot from the simulator
costs ~72ms while the daemon polls every ~67ms, so 15fps is what the source can physically give. A
knob would promise what the pipeline cannot deliver. (Adaptive bitrate — the daemon adjusting on its
own — is deliberately not built either; quality is the client's explicit choice.)

**Detecting a daemon that predates this feature.** This matters in practice: the client updates
itself through the App Store while the daemon is upgraded by hand, so a new client *will* meet old
daemons.

**Do not probe with `attach`** — an older daemon silently ignores unknown JSON fields and attaches
at its own numbers, so the `scale` you sent appears to succeed and does nothing.

Probe with `quality` on `bulk` **before you attach**. With nothing attached there is no feed to
rebuild, so the probe is free, and the two daemons answer with different codes:

| Daemon | Reply to `{"type":"quality"}` with nothing attached |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| supports quality | `code: "no_attachment"` — it understood, there was just nothing to apply it to |
| too old          | `code: "unknown_type"` — no such request; hide the control |

Probing *after* attaching would work too, but it would rebuild the feed and cost you ~1.5s.

**On `attached`'s `w`/`h`.** They are the simulator's **native** pixel size — *not* the video
track's resolution, which is `scale` times smaller. Nothing breaks because of this: touch
coordinates are normalized `[0,1]` against the displayed frame, so only the aspect ratio matters
and scaling preserves it. Use `w`/`h` for aspect; read the track's real dimensions from your
decoder.

### Error codes

Every `error` message — from the broker during signalling, or from the daemon over `control` —
carries a human-readable `msg` **and** a stable machine `code`. Branch on `code`, not on the text of
`msg` (the text may change). `bulk` errors follow the same contract with their own codes, listed
with the bulk channel in [the live session](#the-live-session-control-and-video). The signalling and
control codes:

| `code` | Sent by | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `offline`      | broker | The target Mac's daemon is not currently registered. Wake the Mac and retry. |
| `busy`         | broker | Another client holds this Mac's single session. Ask the user, then either stop or rejoin with `"takeover":true` — never auto-retry in a loop. |
| `taken_over`   | broker | Your session was ended by another device joining with `takeover`; the socket closes right after. |
| `pair_expired` | daemon | The pairing window expired (TTL passed) or was cancelled. Generate a fresh QR. |
| `pair_used`    | daemon | The one-time pairing secret was already consumed by a successful pairing. Generate a fresh QR. |
| `pair_invalid` | daemon | No pairing window is open, or the enrollment proof didn't match. |
| `bad_request`  | daemon | The lifecycle request was malformed — a `boot`/`attach`/`restart`/`shutdown` with no `udid`. |
| `boot_failed` / `shutdown_failed` / `restart_failed` | daemon | That power operation failed on the Mac; `msg` carries the toolchain's reason. |
| attach codes   | daemon | Listed with [Attaching a simulator](#attaching-a-simulator) — they carry `retryable` too. |

`pair_*` codes accompany a rejected `join`/`connect` during pairing; `offline` comes back when you
`join` a Mac that isn't online, `busy` when someone else is already on it. A `join` carrying the key
that already holds the session is a reconnect, not a second viewer: it takes the slot over and never
gets `busy`. A `busy` refusal never reaches the daemon, so a pairing secret sent with it stays
unspent — the confirmed retry can reuse it verbatim plus `"takeover":true`. Lifecycle failures also carry `operation` (which request failed) and
`udid` (which device). An `error` with no `code` is a generic failure — surface its `msg`.

## TURN and subscriptions

WebRTC tries to connect the two peers directly. On the same network or with friendly routers, it
succeeds using **host candidates** or **STUN** — no relay, no cost. **STUN is always provided, to
everyone, free.**

When both peers are behind strict NATs and can't reach each other directly, WebRTC needs a **TURN**
relay — a server that forwards the encrypted media. Relays cost real bandwidth, so on the default
(public) infrastructure **TURN is gated behind a subscription**. The media stays end-to-end
encrypted even through TURN; the relay only sees ciphertext.

What this means in practice:

- **Free / no subscription:** you get STUN. You can connect on the same Wi-Fi and across many home
  networks. If both ends are on hostile NATs, the connection may fail — that's the upsell moment.
- **Active subscription:** the broker additionally hands you **short-lived TURN credentials** in the
  `iceServers` message, so the relay fallback is available.

The relay is **Cloudflare Realtime TURN** — a managed anycast service, so there's no relay host to
run or firewall. The entry the broker issues inside `iceServers` is what Cloudflare mints:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "turn:turn.cloudflare.com:3478?transport=udp",
    "turns:turn.cloudflare.com:443?transport=tcp"
  ],
  "username": "<opaque>",
  "credential": "<opaque>"
}
```

Unlike coturn's REST-API mechanism there's no shared secret to HMAC locally: credentials only come
from Cloudflare's API, so the broker fetches one with its TURN key and reuses it for every active
subscriber until it's halfway to expiry (default TTL 24h — Cloudflare tears down an allocation once
its credential lapses, so the TTL has to outlive a session). `turns:...:443` is the entry that gets
through corporate and hotel networks.

When you self-host, **you decide the policy** — bring your own Cloudflare TURN key and subscription
store, or skip TURN entirely and run STUN-only.

### The subscription API

A subscription is a claim — "this client key is entitled until this date" — stored at the broker and
keyed by the client's public key (the **same** `clientPubKey` used in pairing and the key challenge).
The client submits it to the broker over plain HTTPS:

```
POST /v1/subscription
Content-Type: application/json
X-App-Sig:     <base64( HMAC-SHA256( appSecret, canonical ) )>
X-Account-Sig: <base64( Ed25519-sign( clientPrivateKey, canonical ) )>

{
  "client_pubkey": "<clientPubKey>",
  "product_id":    "pro.monthly",
  "issued_at":     "2026-06-10T12:00:00Z",
  "expires_at":    "2026-07-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Both signatures are computed over the **same canonical byte string**, the four fields joined by a
`0x1F` (unit-separator) byte, in this exact order:

```
client_pubkey  0x1F  product_id  0x1F  expires_at  0x1F  issued_at
```

There are two signatures because they answer two different questions:

- **`X-App-Sig` — "is this our app build?"** An HMAC keyed by a shared **app secret**. This is a
  *weak* barrier on purpose: the secret is baked into the client binary, so anyone who reverse-
  engineers the app can extract it. It deters casual scripting, nothing more.
  - The app secret is configured on the broker via the **`SIMCAST_APP_SECRET`** environment variable.
    In development the value is `dev-app-secret`. (If the broker is started without it, the app-sig
    barrier is simply disabled.) The same string must be compiled into the client to produce a valid
    `X-App-Sig`.
- **`X-Account-Sig` — "does this account really authorize this?"** A real **Ed25519 signature** by the
  client's private key. This is the cryptographic boundary: it proves the holder of `clientPubKey`
  authorized the claim.

Rules and behavior:

- **`issued_at`** must be within ±48 h of the server clock (loose, since client clocks drift).
- **Idempotent, last-write-wins by `issued_at`:** re-posting is safe; only a *newer* `issued_at`
  overwrites the stored row. Apps can spam this on foreground/background without harm.
- **Response:** `200 OK` (empty body) on success; `401` on a bad signature; `400` on malformed
  timestamps. The subscription is "active" while `expires_at` is in the future — that's exactly what
  the TURN gate checks.
- **`GET /v1/subscription/me?pubkey=…&ts=…&sig=…`** returns the caller's current subscription (the
  `sig` is an Ed25519 signature over `pubkey 0x1F ts`, with a fresh `ts`). Convenience only — the
  authoritative record is the broker's store.

> Today subscriptions are **client-asserted** (the app vouches for itself). A future server-side Apple
> receipt check can replace the trust source without changing this wire shape.

## Putting it together: a client's lifecycle

1. **Pair once** — scan the QR from the Mac, prove knowledge of `S`, get pinned. (One time per Mac.)
2. **Watch presence** — open a `watch` socket to see which paired Macs are online. (No auth.)
3. **Subscribe (optional)** — `POST /v1/subscription` so TURN relay is available on strict networks.
4. **Connect** — `join` an online Mac, pass the key challenge, exchange offer/answer, verify the
   daemon's signature. On the control channel the daemon greets you with `hello` (Mac name, macOS
   version, and `paired: true`).
5. **Use it** — over the P2P link: `list` / `boot` / `shutdown` / `attach` a simulator, watch
   H.264, send taps, swipes, Home, keys. `detach` or close to end.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Daemon** | `simbeamd`, the program on the Mac that owns the simulators and serves the stream. |
| **Broker** | `simbeam-signal`, the rendezvous/signalling server that helps peers find each other. |
| **Client** | The iPad app (or browser) that views and controls a simulator. |
| **daemonID** | The daemon's Ed25519 **public key** (base64). Stable per Mac; serves as its address on the broker. Public, not a secret. |
| **clientPubKey** | The client's Ed25519 public key. Pinned by the daemon during pairing; identifies the account. |
| **Pinning** | Storing the other side's public key as "trusted," so future connections are authenticated by key. |
| **Pairing** | One-time introduction (secret-gated) that makes the daemon trust a client key and vice-versa. |
| **Signalling** | The exchange of small handshake messages (offer/answer/challenge) needed to set up a WebRTC link. The broker does this. |
| **Rendezvous** | Same idea as signalling — the broker is where two parties meet to start a connection. |
| **WebRTC** | The browser/native standard for real-time peer-to-peer audio/video/data. Carries the video and control channel. |
| **SDP** | Session Description Protocol — the text blob describing a WebRTC connection, exchanged as **offer** and **answer**. |
| **Offerer / Answerer** | In a WebRTC handshake, the side that proposes the session (client) vs. the side that responds (daemon). |
| **DataChannel** | A WebRTC channel for arbitrary data, separate from the media track. Two here: `control` (input, unreliable) and `bulk` (screenshots, quality and lifecycle — reliable+ordered). |
| **ICE** | Interactive Connectivity Establishment — how WebRTC discovers a working network path between two peers. |
| **ICE candidate / host candidate** | A possible address/path for the connection; a *host* candidate is a direct local-network address. |
